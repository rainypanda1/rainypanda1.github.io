Again, I don’t plan on anyone finding this website because it’s not being used anywhere but thought I’d add a contact page because it makes the website feel more complete.

Matrix is convinient [@cloudpanda:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@cloudpanda:matrix.org). And of course [email](mailto:cloudpanda1@proton.me) exists too. [Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org/e26a0672489d142a717d7f90d6c8c6e046932ab3) also lists some accounts and has verification linked with them, (it's a cool project).
