Hello! Welcome to my website. I made this website because I like websites and computers in general. This is a website made for fun, and doesnâ€™t really serve a purpose but I might add things to it.

This website uses [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with the [terminimal](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal) theme.

It might also be cool as kind of a digital time capsule. Future me can see what I was writing about years before and that might be fun. I enjoy looking back at old projects and judging the me of the past.

Basically, websites are fun and I want an excuse to have and update one.
