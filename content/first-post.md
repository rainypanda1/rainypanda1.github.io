I've been learning more about static website generation like Jekyll and Hugo, as well as Zola (what this website is built with). After using just HTML and CSS, it makes things much much easier.

I find it cool that Zola is written with Rust, and this theme especially takes so minimal resources that the website loads super fast. As mentioned in the about page, I don't have a reason to make or have a website but they're fun so why not. It will also probably host some pages that are helpful to me.
